# 🚀 Getting Started

Welcome to **Ponzi Land**, the first fully on-chain game where you can **buy, trade, and earn using any ERC-20 token**. This permissionless economic battleground challenges you to **outmaneuver, out-trade, and outlast** the competition in a decentralized, token-agnostic system.

---

## 🏗 Setting Up

Before you dive into Ponzi Land, make sure you’re prepared:

1. **Connect Your Wallet** – You'll need a Starknet-compatible wallet.
2. **Acquire Land** – You can **either**:
   - **Buy land in a Dutch auction** (new land sales).
   - **Buy land from another player** who has listed it for sale.
3. **List Your Land for Sale** – **Every land you buy must be listed for sale.**  
   - You set the **sale price** and choose any **ERC-20 token** for the listing.  
   - The chosen token must be paired with a liquid token (LORDS, STRK, ETH).  
4. **Understand the Tax System** – Your tax rate is based on the **sale price** you set:
   - A percentage (**2%**) of your sale price is taxed per day.
   - The tax is paid in the **same token you list the land for**.
   - The **8 neighboring tiles receive the tax**.
5. **Stay Liquid or Lose Your Land** – If your land runs out of staked tokens, it **gets reclaimed and re-auctioned**.

## 🎮 Core Mechanics

Ponzi Land revolves around **three fundamental principles**:

### 🏗 1. Acquire & Stake Land  
- Purchase land through **Dutch auctions** or **from other players**.
- You **must** list the land for sale immediately after purchasing it.
- Choose **any ERC-20 token** (must be in an LP with a liquid token like LORDS, STRK, or ETH).
- Stake **any amount** of that token to set the sale price.

### 💰 2. Earn & Survive  
- Earn passive **taxes** from neighboring landowners.
- Be strategic—**higher sale prices mean higher taxes**.
- If your staked balance runs out, you **lose the land**.

### 🎭 3. Manipulate & Flip  
- Buy undervalued land and resell for profit.
- Watch out for **LP manipulation**—if a token loses liquidity, the land **gets nuked**.
- **Nuke Mechanic**: If a token becomes illiquid, the system will **automatically reclaim the land**.

## 🔥 How to Get Land

There are **two ways** to acquire land:
1. **Dutch Auction** – New land tiles enter the game through an auction where the price decreases over time until someone buys it.
2. **Buy from Another Player** – Purchase land that other players have listed for sale.

👉 *You only need to do one of these to start playing—no need to participate in both!*

## 💰 Tax System (How You Pay & Earn)

- **The tax rate is determined by your sale price** – the higher you price your land, the more tax you pay.
- **Taxes are paid in the token you chose for the land sale**.
- **Taxes go to the 8 neighboring tiles** around your land.
- If your **staked balance runs out**, you **lose ownership**, and the land goes back to auction.

---

## ☢️ Nuke Mechanic (Anti-Rug Protection)

To prevent manipulation:
- Every land has a **sell price, token, and LP address**.
- The system **checks the LP liquidity** of each land’s token.
- If liquidity is **too low**, the land is **nuked and becomes ownerless**.

---

## 💸 Claiming Taxes

Since **Starknet is static**, taxes aren't auto-distributed. Instead:
- You must **manually claim** your tax revenue.
- Use the **claim button** (multi-call enabled) to collect from all neighbors.
- Taxes accumulate over time until collected.

## 🏁 Your First Move

1. **Choose Your Entry** – Get land **through an auction or buy from a player**.
2. **Set a Competitive Sale Price** – This affects your tax rate.
3. **Stake & Earn** – Ensure you have enough staked to keep your land active.
4. **Claim & Flip** – Reinvest earnings, flip land, and grow your holdings.
