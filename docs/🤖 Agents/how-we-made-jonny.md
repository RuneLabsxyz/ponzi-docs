# üõ† How We Built Johnny

Johnny, Ponzi Land's first AI agent, represents a unique blend of **on-chain automation** and **social intelligence**. Here's how we brought him to life.

### üß† Core Architecture

Johnny is build with an early version of [Daydreams](https://www.dreams.fun/), specifically a fork of 0.0.4 which can be found [here](https://github.com/Runelabsxyz/daydreams). It works through having a core orchestrator for the agent that is responsible for handling thoughts created by the conscioussness, as well as inputs from discord and twitter. It also has access to the chain of thought that the the orchestrator can use to execute actions in ponziland. 

The conscioussness is set to run every 5 minutes, and will produce a thought about either doing something in ponziland or sharing a thought on twitter. It has access to the 5 most recent thoughts it has produced to avoid repeating itself. If it decides to something in ponziland, like checking on its lands, it will create a chain of thought to do so, and then the chain of thought will return the outcome of the action to the orchestrator, where it can decide how to handle it.

All of the charactarization is done in the conscioussness and the orchestrator/processor. The conscioussness produces thoughts while the processor handles them and decides what actions to take. At the moment the actions it has access to are:
- discord_message
- tweet
- ponziland_action (Chain of Thought)

# ‚õìÔ∏è Chain of Thought 
The chain of thought is able to fetch data from ponziland, at the moment it has access to the following queries: 

### Ponziland Queries
- balances
- auctions
- lands
- claims
- neighbors
- nukeable_lands

and can execute the following starknet calls:
### PonziLand Actions
- buy
- bid
- increase_stake
- increase_price
- nuke

### ERC20
- approve for ponziland

So when johnny decides to check on his lands, the chain of thought will make the query and then return the results to the orchestrator/processor, where it can decide how to handle it. Then it can potentially create a new ponziland_action to follow up on the thought. The prompt in the chain of thought that determines whether the query has been completed, and if the chain of thought should be terminated, has been modified to return a summary of all actions that have been taken and all data that has been fetched.

This means that after the chain of thought decides if an action is complete, the processor also makes a similar decision while including other context like the character data and the previous actions that have been taken. So if Johnny is going to bid on an auction, it will usually take 2 chain of thoughts, one to fetch the auction data, and one to make the bid, but doing it this way enables keeping the character data separate from the chain of thought and is required to have important decisions like whether to buy a land be done on the processor level rather than the chain of thought level.

Also, the processor has been simplified in this version to only use the masterProcessor, which has been tailored to handle the thoughts produced by the conscioussness and is therefore bad at handling messages at the moment. 


This is just Version 0.1 of our AI agent system. As we move toward multiple agents and more complex interactions, we'll be expanding these systems significantly.
