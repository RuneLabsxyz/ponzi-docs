# 📈 Level Up  

In **Ponzi Land**, land ownership isn't just about flipping for profit—**long-term holders are rewarded**. The longer you own a plot, the more powerful it becomes. Through the **building leveling system**, landowners can upgrade their properties over time to **increase their tax earnings**.  

![Building Level Progression](/img/building_leveling.png)  
*(Above: A visual of the three building levels. Higher-level buildings are **bigger, flashier, and more Ponzi**.)*

## ⏳ How Buildings Level Up  

- **Level 1** – All newly acquired land starts at Level 1.  
- **Level 2** – If you hold a piece of land for **1 week**, you can upgrade it to Level 2.  
- **Level 3** – If you hold the land for **1 additional month (total of ~5 weeks)**, you can upgrade it to Level 3.  

👉 *Buildings do not level up automatically—you must manually upgrade them once the time requirement is met.*

## 💰 Tax Boosts from Upgrades  

Higher-level buildings **increase your passive tax income**:  

| Building Level | Time Required | Tax Bonus |
|---------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Level 1**   | 0 weeks       | Base tax (X%) |
| **Level 2**   | 1 week        | **+10% tax income** |
| **Level 3**   | 1 month (after Lvl 2) | **+25% tax income** |

### 🏗 **Ponzi Buildings Grow Over Time**  
- **Level 1**: A modest little **Ponzi shack**—nothing special yet.  
- **Level 2**: Bigger, flashier—your **Ponzi empire is expanding**.  
- **Level 3**: A **full-blown Ponzi fortress**, dripping in luxury, hype, and maximum tax collection.

## 🔄 Upgrading Process  

1. **Hold your land** for at least **1 week** (for Level 2) or **1 month** (for Level 3).  
2. **Use the "Upgrade" button** to increase the building level (requires a small fee).  
3. **Start earning more tax** from neighboring tiles.

## 🎯 Strategic Considerations  

- **Flipping vs. Holding** – Do you sell early for quick profits, or hold to maximize long-term tax earnings?  
- **Neighborhood Planning** – A cluster of high-level buildings creates **compounding rewards**, as multiple upgraded tiles benefit from the increased tax flow.  
- **Market Influence** – Higher-level buildings may **increase the perceived value of surrounding land**, making neighboring plots more desirable.
