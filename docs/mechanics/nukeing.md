# ☢️ Nuking Land

Ponzi Land is a **free-market battlefield**, but that doesn’t mean players can manipulate the system unchecked. The **Nuke Mechanic** is designed to **prevent liquidity traps**, ensuring that every land remains tradable and fair play is enforced.  

---

## ⚠️ Why Does Nuking Exist?  

Some players might try to **drain a token’s liquidity** to make their land impossible to buy. This would create a **dead zone** where no one can trade the land, breaking the economy.  

To prevent this, **Ponzi Land automatically nukes land** when its associated token no longer has sufficient liquidity in its LP (Liquidity Pool).  

---

## 💣 How Nuking Works  

Each piece of land has:  
✅ A **Sell Price** (set in any ERC-20 token).  
✅ A **Staked Token Balance** (for paying taxes).  
✅ A **Liquidity Pool (LP) Address** (to ensure the token is tradeable).  

The system **periodically checks** the LP of every land’s token. If a token’s liquidity is too low:  

1. 🚨 **The land gets nuked**, meaning it becomes **ownerless**.  
2. 🔥 **All staked tokens in that land are burned**.  
3. 🏗 **The land goes back to auction**, resetting its economy.  

---

## ✅ Natively Supported Tokens  

To make things **easier and safer** for players, Ponzi Land’s **front-end UI** comes preloaded with **natively supported tokens** that have **active and highly liquid LPs**.  

💡 *This greatly reduces the risk of land getting nuked when using these tokens.*  

However…  

👉 **We still don’t take responsibility if a nuke happens.** The market is wild, and anything can happen. Stay vigilant.

## 🔄 Adding Your Own Tokens  

For the true **Ponzi degenerates**, we allow users to **add their own ERC-20 tokens** to the game.  

- You can list land in **any ERC-20 token** (as long as it has an LP).  
- If your token’s liquidity drops too low, **your land gets nuked**.  
- This is **high risk, high reward**—use at your own discretion.

## 🚀 How to Avoid Getting Nuked  

If you own land in Ponzi Land, you need to ensure:  
- The token you listed your land in **still has a liquid LP** (must be paired with ETH, STRK, or LORDS).  
- The **sell price isn't absurdly high**, which could discourage buyers and increase risk.  
- You're **not using obscure or dying tokens** that could lose liquidity.

## ☢️ Nuking as a Strategy  

While nuking is meant to **protect the economy**, **smart players can weaponize it**:  
- **Triggering a Nuke** – If a rival’s land is tied to a low-liquidity token, you could drain liquidity and **force their land to reset**.  
- **Watching the Markets** – If you notice a token’s LP drying up, you can **sell land ahead of a nuke event**.  
- **Reclaiming Nuked Land** – Since nuked land goes back to auction, you could **snipe it at a discount**.

## 🔥 Final Thoughts  

Nuking ensures that **Ponzi Land remains fair, competitive, and manipulatable—but only within the rules**. Stay sharp, monitor liquidity, and don’t get caught holding worthless land.
